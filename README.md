## editor-gui
[VIEW LIVE DEMO](http://lerp-io.github.io/editor-gui)

A simple and flexible Javascript GUI library for internal development tools and editors.

Built for React.

similar to tools such dat.gui, control-panel, guify, imgui, qt.

unfortunately none of those libraries quite fit the project at hand and the features that i needed, so i decided to quickly write up a new library with all the main features of the other ones and with some extra stuff that i needed as well as make it easy to customize and and extend with custom features in the future which some libraries had and others didnt.

the gui library that did however have all the features that i needed was imgui/qt but unfortunately that's written for c++

Anyway, this uses the newer react functional components and the api is down below.
