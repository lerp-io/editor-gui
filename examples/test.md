The following example is a demonstration of all the current components and features - a layout component with 2 anchors. The first anchor contains an infinitely recursive menu and a box containing different input fields. The second anchor contains a resizable box. Drag the anchor handles to move the menus around and see the effects.

If you drag the menu anchor while the menu is opened, you will notice how the submenus and boxes dynamically change their position and alignment, overflowing and clamping to the viewport boundries when needed. Positions are automatically computed each render to provide optimal visibility without extra configurations even if certain parameters are set. For example, the red menu alternates between vertical and horizontal and has a preference for aligning children to the right border. We will go over alignment options later.
