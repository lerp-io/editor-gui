## A simple javascript component library for **react**.

---

Use this library to help you build editor panels for html5 canvas or webgl projects. Menus, Boxes, and Inputs are easy to create and will work well in any position of the screen.

*editor-gui* was inspired by other similar libraries such as *imgui* for c++, *datgui* for javascript, or *ofxDatgui* for openframeworks.

One major thing to note about this library is that all components are fixed to viewport which means they cannot be relatively positioned (Anchors, Menus, Boxes). The examples below are rendered inside an iframe.
